# Stream Finder Plugin

Ladies and Boomermen, I present to you the plugin that can detect and capture live twitch streamers in your Rocket League matches! Yes you heard right, a stream detector.

This plugin gathers the player names in your lobby, searches them up on the twitch database, and will be able to find a live streamer in your lobbies. The program will also be able to record the streams in the background during gameplay with no performance impact whatsoever!

Ever wondered if that "TTV" is live? Well you got it! Or if that random player is live too? Well dammit you got that too!
