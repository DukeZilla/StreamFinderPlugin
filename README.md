# StreamFinderPlugin

A Rocket League Bakkesmod plugin that will detect live twitch streamers in your matches!

The program will get the player names from the server, search all the names up on twitch, if the program picks up a live streamer
a discord notification will be sent to you via webhook link. (DM coming soon...)

The program uses several search methods to increase the probability of finding a live streamer that is in your match.
The live stream finding event will also be logged in a text file.

So in case you're wondering if that "TTV" is live? Well you got it, or if that "Player" is also live? Well damn you got that too!

Stream finder plugin.
